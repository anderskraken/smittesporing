# ![üëã Smittesporing](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3652587/76966051-44f38700-691d-11ea-9e6f-029972c943f9.jpg)

A pro-bono open source frontend project looking for API and backing by the Norwegian government.

With Smittesporing the government can
- Find sources of infection
- Track corona symptoms live
- See where there's an outbreak
- Understand who needs treatment for covid-19 in the coming week

With Smittesporing the end users can
- Share their current symptoms and movements with the government

### ü§© Why?

Because we want to help save lives. No private gain in making this happen.

### üéØ How?

**Initial:** Continue work on vision, pitch and direction of the project.   
**Gate 1:** We need government support. Without government support within Friday 20th of March we will kill this idea.  
**Gate 2:** We need to address privacy and security concerns.  
**Gate 3:** Integrate towards government backend

### üîê Security

We create the frontend following best practice wrt privacy and security (ssl pinning, strong encryption using secure enclave). 

The backend for this project is out of scope for us, but if government wants help implementing backend I think developers of Norway is ready to scramble!
