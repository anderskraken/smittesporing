# Smittesporing

👋 A pro-bono plug-and-use open source project for the Norwegian government to monitor covid-19.

With Smittesporing the government can
- Find sources of infection
- Track corona symptoms live
- See where there's an outbreak
- Understand how many people which are highly likely to be infected with covid-19

With Smittesporing the end users can
- Share their current symptoms and movements with the government


##### Why?

Because we want to help save lives. No private gain in making this happen.

##### Gates

Without government support within Friday 20th of March we will kill this idea.
